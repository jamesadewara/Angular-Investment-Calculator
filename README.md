# Angular Investment Calculator

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.6.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Running the build with http-server

To serve the built project using `http-server`, first ensure you have `http-server` installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

After building the project with:

```bash
ng build
```

Navigate to the `dist/` directory and start the server:

```bash
cd dist/your-project-name
http-server
```

This will start a local server and you can view your application by navigating to the provided URL, typically `http://localhost:8080/`.

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
